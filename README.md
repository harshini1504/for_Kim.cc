# The most challenging problem I solved recently
The most challenging problem I solved recently was Combination Sum IV (LeetCode 377). At first, I approached it like a normal recursion/backtracking problem, but the number of possibilities blew up so fast that the solution became unusable. After struggling with it for a while, I realized the real trick was to look at it as a dynamic programming counting problem instead of a search problem. The hardest part was figuring out how to build the solution for every smaller target so that those results could be reused for bigger targets. I also had to rethink the recurrence a few times to make sure it respected the fact that order matters in this question. Once I shifted to a DP approach, the solution became clean, fast, and surprisingly elegant. This problem really pushed me to think differently and strengthened my confidence in converting recursive intuition into DP logic.
